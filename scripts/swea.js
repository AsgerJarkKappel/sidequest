            <span>TA-HuB was a design concept aimed at facilitating hybrid
                collaboration in study cafés specifically for hard science courses.
                TA-HuB was conceptualized as a website that uses technologies to connect remote stu-
                dents during study café. It builds on the concept of discussion boards
                to increase efficiency of students and teaching assistants. Further-
                more, TA-HuB allows students to learn asynchronously which is
                a strength for complex theory and exam studying, asynchronous
                learning also allows students with jobs or with children to partic-
                ipate in the collaborative learning.<br><br>

                        TA-HuB consist of two main parts, a study café, and a discussion board. 
                        To better illustrate functionallity and use-cases I have provided to scenarios below 
            </span>

                The first scenario shown on this figure illustrates how our system
                can be used for synchronous and asynchronous learning. The scenario
                starts with study group A of three students working on an
                assignment. Group A have trouble with one of the exercises and
                need help, so they post a question on the discussion board. The
                question is complicated to formulate without visual aid, so they
                upload pictures of their problem and write their question referring to
                the pictures. A second study group B browses TA-HuB’s discussion
                board and finds group A’s question, group B also have trouble with
                the same exercise so one of the students from the study group B
                presses the subscribe button on the question, this feature subscribes
                every member of group B to that question.
                The next day, group A have not received an answer on the discussion 
                board, they then add their question to the queue of the study
                café. Only one of the students from group A can show up to the
                physical study café, one member is home, and one is at work. The
                members of group B are all present in the study café. When the
                study café session begins the students from both study groups are
                notified and when the TA is finished with the question before their
                question the students are notified that it’s their turn. The located
                students walk into the designated TA room, the student from home
                clicks on his notification and is directed into a video call, and the
                working student does not join.
                The TA read the question and understands their problem as they
                provided helpful visuals. The TA begins explaining the theory and
                how the students should approach the task by giving hints and
                writing on the whiteboard, the remote student asks for clarification
                on a step in his answer, and the TA provides more information. The
                students understand the explanations and the TA presses a finish
                button on his computer, which automatically saves the recording
                of the question on the Archive-page in the system.
                The student from group A who worked is home later that day, he
                open TA-HuB and navigates to the Archive-page, he finds his study
                group’s question and watches the recording of the explanation. He
                does not fully understand a step in the explanation, so he re watches
                that part a couple of times until he understands.
                The next day the group A have planned to finish the assignment,
                they start working on the difficult exercise and some disagreement
                on the steps occur, so the group opens TA-HuB’s Archive-page and
                finds their question and re watches the whole explanation together
                until they agree on what to do next.

            <span>The second scenario as seen on this figure illustrate a strong use
                case of the discussion forum. The scenario begins as the first, a
                study group have trouble with an exercise, and they post a question
                on the discussion board. Two students in a different location also
                on TA-HuB, sorts the questions based on date and sees the study
                groups question. The students have just completed the task and
                writes an answer to the question. The study group is notified and
                read the answer together and completes the exercise</span>

            <span style="margin-bottom:10px;">The project gave me experience with <span style="font-weight:bold;">Full stack Design.</span>
                The project began with creating insight within the domain and understanding user behaviour and needs throughresearch methods.
                The research was used to conceptualize system requirements and several prototype iterations were created andevaluated. The best parts of
                every prototype was combined for final concept which was evaluated with target users.
                The concept was very complicated to solve, as their were different types of users with specific needs and constraints. 
                We used an innovative framework to conceptualize how questions would be qued for the study café to allow every student
                a fair chance of partaking, even students who would be unable to physically attend the study café or even connect remotely during the café.
                The quing of students questions was something our collaborative part Microsoft Cambridge Research was very impressed with as we handled a complex
                and unfair scenario by innovating on the simple concept of quing.
